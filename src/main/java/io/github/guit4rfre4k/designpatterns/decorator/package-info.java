/**
 * This package contains all classes connected with the demo of the Decorator
 * design pattern.
 * 
 * The example with router shows a sample implementation of the decorator design
 * pattern. In this example it is assumed, that the Router class represents some
 * router device to which the user can send some commands (in example, commands
 * are unreal and used as demo). Decorators are used in order to add some extra
 * functionalities to the base implementation like auto-connecting, automatic
 * disconnection, clearing some resources in AutoClosable manner etc...
